# rm ‚Äî A Minimal Cross-Platform `rm` Clone for Windows and .NET

A lightweight C# implementation of the Unix `rm` command for Windows, built to behave consistently across platforms.  
It supports recursive deletion, force deletion, wildcard expansion, and standard POSIX-style flags (`-r`, `-f`, `-rf`, `--help`).

This is **not a wrapper for PowerShell‚Äôs `Remove-Item`**, but a standalone executable designed for developers who prefer native Unix-style tools on Windows.

## üß∞ Features

- Supports `-r`, `-f`, and combined flags (`-rf`, `-fr`)
- Handles multiple files and directories in one command
- Expands wildcards (`*`, `?`) like Bash
- Honors `--` to stop flag parsing
- Prints human-readable error messages
- Safe default behavior: refuses to delete directories unless `-r` is provided
- `--help` flag for built-in usage info
- Single-file binary (`rm.exe`) built via .NET Publish
